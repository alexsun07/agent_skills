# SGLang AMD Benchmark

Benchmark sglang LLM serving on AMD Instinct GPUs across parallel configurations (TP/DP/EP) and workload shapes (ISL/OSL/Concurrency). This skill runs in **mix mode** (non-disaggregated) — prefill and decode happen on the same GPUs. It produces a performance baseline and suggests config-level optimizations.

## Key Metrics

Every benchmark collects these metrics per (ISL, OSL, Concurrency) combination:


| Metric             | Unit  | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| TTFT               | ms    | Time To First Token — latency from request to first token |
| TPOT               | ms    | Time Per Output Token — average inter-token latency       |
| Input throughput   | tok/s | Input tokens processed per second across all requests     |
| Output throughput  | tok/s | Output tokens generated per second across all requests    |
| Total throughput   | tok/s | Input + Output token throughput combined                  |
| Per-GPU throughput | tok/s | Total throughput / number of GPUs                         |


Per-GPU throughput is the most important efficiency metric — it shows how well each GPU is utilized. Two configs might have similar total throughput, but the one using fewer GPUs has better per-GPU throughput and is more cost-efficient.

## Common Workspace Layout

The standard development environment uses `/sgl-workspace` as the root workspace inside Docker containers:

```
/sgl-workspace/
├── sglang/                    # sglang source (installed via pip -e, dev mode)
├── aiter/                     # AITER source (AMD AI Tensor Engine)
├── mori/                      # Mori (communication library)
└── <model_short>_<YYYYMMDD>/  # benchmark output directories (created by this skill)
```

All benchmark artifacts (logs, reports) are saved under `/sgl-workspace/` by default. If the user specifies a different workspace, use that instead.

## Core Principle: Ask First, Execute Later

**Do NOT guess or assume any configuration.** Every detail must be explicitly confirmed by the user before execution begins. The workflow has two distinct phases:

1. **Planning phase** (Steps 0–1): Gather ALL information through conversation. Ask questions, wait for answers. Do not proceed to the next question until the current one is answered.
2. **Confirmation gate** (Step 2): Present the complete plan as a summary. Get explicit "go ahead" from the user.
3. **Execution phase** (Steps 3–4): Only after full confirmation, run the benchmarks.

If at any point you're unsure about a parameter, **ask**. Never fill in a value the user hasn't confirmed.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Model & Environment Discovery

**Ask the user these questions one by one. Wait for each answer before asking the next.**

#### 0a. Model selection — ask this FIRST

**"Which model do you want to benchmark?"**

The user may respond with:

- A full HuggingFace model ID (e.g., `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528`)
- A short name (e.g., "DeepSeek R1", "Llama 70B", "Qwen 235B")
- A local path to the model weights

If the user gives a short name, confirm the exact model ID (e.g., "Do you mean `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528`?").

#### 0b. Single-node or multi-node?

**"Is this single-node or multi-node?"**

- Single-node: 1 node, typically 8 GPUs
- Multi-node: ask how many nodes and GPUs per node

If multi-node, also ask for:

- Network interface (`GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME`)
- InfiniBand HCAs (`NCCL_IB_HCA`)
- Head node IP (`SGLANG_HOST_IP`)

#### 0c. Access the GPU node

**"How do I access the GPU node?"**

- SSH command? (e.g., `ssh user@gpu-node`)
- Docker container? (e.g., `docker exec -it <container> bash`)
- Already on the machine?
- For multi-node: ask about access to each node

#### 0d. Probe the environment

Once connected, probe automatically (no need to ask — just run and report back):

- Run `rocm-smi --showid` → report GPU count, model (MI355X, MI300X, MI308X), architecture
- Run `pip show sgl-kernel 2>/dev/null && python3 -c "import sglang; print('sglang version:', sglang.__version__)"` → report sglang version
- Run `pip list | grep -i aiter` → report AITER status
- Check common paths: `/sgl-workspace/sglang`, `/sgl-workspace/aiter`, `/sgl-workspace/mori`

**PYTHONPATH probe (important for Docker environments):** When running inside Docker containers via `docker exec -d` (non-interactive), `.bashrc` is often not sourced due to `[ -z "$PS1" ] && return` guards. This can cause `PYTHONPATH` to be missing paths for editable installs (aiter, mori, sglang), leading to import errors like `ImportError: aiter is required when SGLANG_USE_AITER is set to True`. The `serve.sh` script auto-detects and adds common workspace paths (`/sgl-workspace/aiter`, `/sgl-workspace/mori`, `/sgl-workspace/sglang/python`) to `PYTHONPATH` if they exist but are missing. However, if you encounter import errors, compare the environments:

```bash
# Non-interactive PYTHONPATH (what docker exec -d sees)
docker exec <container> bash -c 'echo $PYTHONPATH'
# Interactive PYTHONPATH (what the user sees)
docker exec <container> bash -ic 'echo $PYTHONPATH' 2>/dev/null
```

If they differ, ensure the missing paths are exported before running `serve.sh`.

**If any probe reveals a broken package or missing dependency, report it to the user and stop.** Do NOT attempt to fix installs, rebuild packages, or debug environment issues yourself — that's the user's responsibility. Just report what's broken and wait for guidance.

#### 0e. Locate model weights

The user may or may not have specified where the model weights are stored. If they haven't provided a path, do a quick search — but don't waste time on this:

Quick places to check:

- `$HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` env var
- `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`
- Common mount points: `/mnt`, `/raid`, `/data`

Note: HuggingFace cache stores models as `models--<Org>--<Name>/snapshots/<hash>/`. For example, `Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-FP8` would be at `models--Qwen--Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-FP8/snapshots/<hash>/`. Look for this pattern.

If you find a match, confirm with the user:

> "I found what looks like the model weights at `/data/models/DeepSeek-R1-0528/`. Is this the right location?"

If nothing turns up quickly, ask:

> "I couldn't find the model weights on this machine. Where are they stored?"

The `--model-path` can be either:
- A **local path** directly to the weights (e.g., `/data/models/DeepSeek-R1/`)
- A **HuggingFace model ID** (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-FP8`) — but only if the weights already exist in `$HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE`. If the weights are at `$HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE/models--<Org>--<Name>`, using the HF model ID is preferred. You can also `export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=<path>` to point to the right cache dir.

Do NOT let sglang trigger a model download — the weights must already be on disk.

#### 0f. Report findings and confirm

Present everything you found to the user:

> "Here's what I have so far:
>
> - **Model**: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528
> - **Weights**: /data/models/DeepSeek-R1-0528/
> - **GPUs**: 8x MI355X (gfx950)
> - **sglang**: v0.5.x at /sgl-workspace/sglang
> - **AITER**: installed
> - **Setup**: single-node
>
> Does this look right? Anything I should know about this environment?"

### Step 1: Configuration Planning

**Ask each of these questions explicitly. Do not move forward until you have clear answers for ALL of them.**

#### 1a. MTP decision (if applicable)

If the model is MTP-capable (detected via `mtp_num_hidden_layers` in config.json, or known models like DeepSeek-R1/V3, Qwen3.5), ask:

**"This model supports Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), which can improve decode throughput. By default we run without MTP for a clean baseline. What would you like to do?"**

1. Run without MTP (baseline only)
2. Run with MTP enabled
3. Run both and compare

If the user wants MTP, determine:
- **MTP steps** (`MTP=N`): typically matches `mtp_num_hidden_layers` from config.json (e.g., 3 for Qwen3.5)
- **MTP algorithm** (`MTP_ALGO`): model-dependent — see `references/server_config.md` for the per-model table

`serve.sh` handles all speculative decoding flags (`--speculative-algorithm`, `--speculative-num-steps`, `--speculative-eagle-topk`, `--speculative-num-draft-tokens`) automatically from `MTP` and `MTP_ALGO`.

#### 1b. Server setup

Check if a sglang server is already running — don't ask the user, just probe:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:30000/health && echo "Server is running" || echo "No server running"
pgrep -fa "sglang.launch_server" || true
```

- If a server is running: inform the user and ask whether to shut it down or use it as-is. By default, shut it down so the skill controls the server lifecycle for each config.
- If no server is running: good — the skill will launch one for each config.

Ask: **"Any additional sglang launch flags you want to use?"** (e.g., `--quantization fp8`, `--chunked-prefill-size`, `--schedule-policy`, etc.)

Note: `--disable-radix-cache` is enabled by default in `serve.sh` for benchmarking. User can opt out with `DISABLE_RADIX_CACHE=0`.

#### 1c. Parallel configurations

This is the most important decision in the benchmark. Read `references/server_config.md` for the full reference on parallelism types, naming conventions, EP modes, and how to reason about config choices.

**Before asking the user**, do the following:

1. **Read the model's `config.json`** from the weights directory directly (it's short). Look for KV heads, Q heads, expert count, and detect attention type (MLA/GQA/MHA). See `references/server_config.md` for the key fields to look for — but note that field names vary across models, so read carefully.
2. **Analyze** the 4 factors described in `references/server_config.md` → "How to Reason About Parallel Config":
  - Weight size vs GPU HBM → which TP values fit?
  - Attention type + KV heads → TP or DP-attention?
  - MoE vs Dense → EP applicable?
  - EP mode → all-to-all or all-reduce?
3. **Present your analysis to the user** — show your reasoning (weight size calc, KV head implications, why certain configs are better). Then present a suggested config table and **ask the user to pick**.
4. **If EP is involved**, ask which EP mode (all-to-all or all-reduce), or suggest benchmarking both.

Wait for the user to respond. If they say "try all of them" or "you decide", confirm your suggested set before proceeding.

#### 1d. Benchmark sweep parameters

**"What ISL (input sequence length), OSL (output sequence length), and concurrency levels do you want to sweep?"**

If the user isn't sure, offer options but still ask them to pick:

> "Some common approaches:
>
> 1. **Specific pairs** — e.g., (ISL=512, OSL=256), (ISL=1024, OSL=512) — good for simulating real workloads
> 2. **Full sweep** — provide separate ISL, OSL, and CON lists, benchmark all combinations
>
> Which approach? And what values?"

If the user says "you pick" or "whatever makes sense", then suggest values and **ask for confirmation before proceeding**:

> "Here's what I'd suggest:
>
> - ISL: 128, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096
> - OSL: 128, 512, 1024, 2048
> - Concurrency: 1, 16, 64, 128, 256
>
> That's 5 × 4 × 5 = 100 runs per config, times 2 configs = 200 total runs.
> Estimated ~3+ hours. Want to proceed with these, or adjust?"

### Step 2: Confirmation Gate

**Do NOT start any benchmark until this step is complete.**

#### Naming convention

Use this pattern for directories:

```
BENCH_DIR=/sgl-workspace/<model_short>_<YYYYMMDD>
```

Per-config dirs: `<CONFIG>_mtp<0|1>` (e.g., `DP8EP8_mtp0`, `TP8_mtp0`)

#### Present the plan summary

> **Benchmark Plan Summary**
>
>
> | Item      | Value                                  |
> | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
> | Model     | deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528           |
> | GPU       | 8x MI355X                              |
> | Mode      | Mix (non-disaggregated)                |
> | Bench dir | `/sgl-workspace/DeepSeek-R1_20260322/` |
>
>
> **Sweep:** ISL=[128, 512, 1024, 2048], OSL=[128, 512, 1024], CON=[1, 16, 64, 128, 256]

#### Confirm configs with dry-run

For each parallel config, **actually run `scripts/serve.sh` with `DRY_RUN=1`** on the GPU node — do NOT construct the launch command manually. The dry-run output shows the exact command that will be executed, ensuring consistency between what the user confirms and what actually runs.

For a small number of configs (2-3), present all dry-run outputs at once. For many configs, present them one by one. Get confirmation before proceeding to execution.

```bash
BENCH_DIR=/sgl-workspace/<model_short>_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Config 1 — dry run
MODEL_PATH=<MODEL_PATH> CONFIG=DP8EP8_A2A MTP=0 \
LOG_DIR=$BENCH_DIR/DP8EP8_A2A_mtp0 DRY_RUN=1 bash serve.sh

# Config 2 — dry run
MODEL_PATH=<MODEL_PATH> CONFIG=TP8 MTP=0 \
LOG_DIR=$BENCH_DIR/TP8_mtp0 DRY_RUN=1 bash serve.sh
```

Show the **full dry-run output** (including the complete formatted sglang launch command with all flags) to the user and ask: **"Do these configs look right?"**

If the user wants changes, adjust and re-run the dry run. Once confirmed, proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Benchmark Execution

Only proceed here after the user has confirmed ALL configs in Step 2.

**Always use `serve.sh` and `bench.sh` to launch the server and run benchmarks.** Do NOT construct sglang commands manually — the scripts handle critical flags (`--enable-dp-attention`, `--enable-dp-lm-head`, `SGLANG_USE_AITER`, `PYTHONPATH`, etc.) that are easy to miss.

#### 3-0. Deploy benchmark scripts to the remote node

The `scripts/serve.sh`, `scripts/bench.sh`, `scripts/stop.sh`, and `scripts/verify_stop.sh` files live in the skill directory on the local machine. `serve.sh`/`bench.sh`/`stop.sh` run inside the container; `verify_stop.sh` MUST run on the host (so it can see PIDs from sibling containers).

```bash
# From local: scripts → remote node → into container (verify_stop.sh stays on the host)
scp scripts/serve.sh scripts/bench.sh scripts/stop.sh scripts/verify_stop.sh <SSH_HOST>:/tmp/
ssh <SSH_HOST> "docker cp /tmp/serve.sh <CONTAINER>:/sgl-workspace/ && docker cp /tmp/bench.sh <CONTAINER>:/sgl-workspace/ && docker cp /tmp/stop.sh <CONTAINER>:/sgl-workspace/"
```

Alternatively, if you're already inside the container, write the script content directly using `cat > /sgl-workspace/serve.sh << 'SCRIPT' ... SCRIPT`.

**Important:** Avoid running scripts through nested `ssh → docker exec → bash -c` with inline heredocs — the quoting becomes unmanageable. Always copy scripts to the remote first, then run them simply with `bash serve.sh`.

#### For each parallel config:

**3a. Launch sglang server**

Launch in background so you can proceed to benchmarking:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=<MODEL_PATH> CONFIG=<CONFIG> MTP=<0|1> \
LOG_DIR=$BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG>_mtp<0|1> \
BACKGROUND=1 bash serve.sh
```

If the user already has a running server, skip the launch and use their URL.

**3b. Wait for server ready**

On AMD GPUs, AITER may JIT-compile CK kernels on first launch — this can take several minutes. Don't kill the process.

**Check the server log** rather than polling the health endpoint. Watch for:
- **Success**: `"The server is fired up and ready to roll!"` in the log → server is ready
- **Fatal error**: `"Traceback (most recent call last)"` in the log → server crashed, report to user

```bash
timeout 900 bash -c '
  tail -f $BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG>_mtp<0|1>/server_*.log 2>/dev/null | while read line; do
    echo "$line"
    echo "$line" | grep -q "The server is fired up and ready to roll" && exit 0
    echo "$line" | grep -q "Traceback (most recent call last)" && exit 1
  done
'
```

Do NOT match generic words like "error" or "exception" — sglang logs many benign messages containing these (e.g., "Ignore import error", "UserWarning").

**3c. Run benchmark**

`bench.sh` no longer writes per-run logs itself. Set `OUTPUT_DIR`; per-run JSONL is written to `${OUTPUT_DIR}/jsonl_dir/` and **you MUST capture stdout+stderr with `2>&1 | tee $OUTPUT_DIR/<name>.log`**.

```bash
OUTPUT_DIR=$BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG>_mtp<0|1> \
MODEL_PATH=<MODEL_PATH> ISL=<ISL> OSL=<OSL> \
CONCURRENCY="<CON1> <CON2> <CON3>" \
bash bench.sh 2>&1 | tee $OUTPUT_DIR/bench_ISL<X>_OSL<Y>.log
```

For multiple ISL/OSL combinations, loop (remember `2>&1 | tee` per invocation):

```bash
export OUTPUT_DIR=$BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG>_mtp<0|1>
for ISL in 128 512 1024 2048; do
  for OSL in 128 512 1024; do
    MODEL_PATH=<MODEL_PATH> ISL=$ISL OSL=$OSL \
    CONCURRENCY="1 16 64 128 256" \
    bash bench.sh 2>&1 | tee $OUTPUT_DIR/bench_ISL${ISL}_OSL${OSL}.log
  done
done
```

**3d. Stop server and repeat**

Kill sglang inside the container, then verify on the host (sibling-container PIDs are invisible from within the container):

```bash
ssh <SSH_HOST> "docker exec <CONTAINER> bash /sgl-workspace/stop.sh"
ssh <SSH_HOST> bash /tmp/verify_stop.sh   # exit 0 = GPUs free; non-zero prints offending PIDs
```

**If a config crashes:** Report the error, run `stop.sh` then `verify_stop.sh`, and move on to the next config. Do NOT debug kernel issues or retry. Document the crash and error message in the final report.

Repeat 3a–3d for each parallel config.

### Step 4: Report

After all configs are benchmarked, generate structured CSV data, a performance plot, and a Markdown report.

#### 4a. Generate CSV from JSONL

For each config directory, run `jsonl_to_csv.py` to extract metrics into an InferenceX-compatible CSV:

```bash
python3 /sgl-workspace/jsonl_to_csv.py \
  --jsonl-dir $BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG>_mtp<N>/jsonl_dir \
  --hardware <HARDWARE> \
  --precision <PRECISION> \
  --model <MODEL_NAME> \
  --date <YYYY-MM-DD> \
  --output $BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG>_mtp<N>/<MODEL>_<HARDWARE>_<PRECISION>.csv
```

Required args:
- `--hardware`: GPU hardware name (e.g. `mi355x`, `b200`, `b300`)
- `--precision`: weight precision (e.g. `fp4`, `fp8`, `bf16`)

Optional args:
- `--model`: model display name (default: auto-detected from model path)
- `--date`: benchmark date (default: today)
- `--output`: output CSV path (default: auto-named in jsonl-dir parent)

The CSV follows InferenceX format with all standard columns (throughput/GPU, TTFT, TPOT, interactivity, ITL, E2E latency, etc.). Time values are stored in **seconds** (matching InferenceX convention, despite column headers saying "ms"). Interactivity = 1000 / TPOT(ms).

#### 4b. Generate performance plot

Run `plot_interactivity.py` to produce a **Token Throughput per GPU vs. Interactivity** chart from one or more CSVs:

```bash
python3 /sgl-workspace/plot_interactivity.py \
  $BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG1>/<CSV1>.csv \
  $BENCH_DIR/<CONFIG2>/<CSV2>.csv \
  -o $BENCH_DIR/interactivity_plot.png
```

You can also include reference CSVs (e.g. from InferenceX) alongside your benchmark CSVs to produce comparison plots. Optional args: `--title`, `--subtitle`, `--dpi` (default: 150).

#### 4c. Write Markdown report

Write a Markdown report to `$BENCH_DIR/benchmark_report.md` that includes:

- Configuration summary (model, GPUs, mode, MTP status)
- Per-config results tables with all metrics + per-GPU throughput
- Cross-config comparison highlighting the best performer for each metric
- Reference to the generated CSV and plot files

Present the report to the user and walk them through the key findings.

## File Organization

```
/sgl-workspace/<model_short>_<YYYYMMDD>/
├── benchmark_report.md                          # final report

```

Each config gets its own directory. `serve.sh` writes `server_<LABEL>.log` into `LOG_DIR`. `bench.sh` writes JSONL into `OUTPUT_DIR`; capture its stdout/stderr to the same `OUTPUT_DIR` via `2>&1 | tee $OUTPUT_DIR/<bench>.log`.

## Important Notes

- This skill covers **mix mode only** (no PD-disaggregation). Prefill and decode run on the same GPUs.
- `serve.sh` sets `SGLANG_USE_AITER=1` automatically. `bench.sh` sets `PYTHONPATH` for sglang's benchmark module automatically. No need to set these manually.
- **Use dummy weights by default** (`LOAD_DUMMY=1`). Dummy weights are sufficient for benchmarking throughput, latency, and parallel config comparison — real weights produce the same performance characteristics. Only use `LOAD_DUMMY=0` if the user explicitly asks for real weights. Real weights take much longer to load (10+ minutes for large models) and are rarely needed for config benchmarking.
- **AITER JIT compilation**: After first server launch on AMD GPUs, AITER may JIT-compile CK kernels for several minutes (you may see "waiting for baton release" or similar messages). This is normal — do NOT kill the process. Wait for the health endpoint to report ready.
- `--random-range-ratio 1.0` ensures exact ISL/OSL lengths (no variation) for reproducible benchmarks.
- `bench.sh` uses `num_prompts = concurrency * 2` — this is handled by the script automatically.
- Between configs, fully kill the sglang server and wait for GPU memory to be freed before relaunching.
- If a benchmark run fails or hangs, check GPU memory usage with `rocm-smi` and server health with the `/health` endpoint.
- **Don't fix broken environments yourself.** If you discover broken packages, missing libraries, or install issues during probing, report to the user and wait. Don't attempt to reinstall, rebuild, or debug — that wastes time and can make things worse.
